Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.<br><br>\nYou can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at.

This means:\n<br><br>\n➣ Sprawling levels that offer a degree of freedom and don't hold the player's hand. Exploring, hunting secrets, backtracking, patience and having to figure out what to do next is key. Monsters and pickups are hand-placed and vary according to the difficulty you play on.\n<br><br>\n➣ Original story packed with lots of lore and a focus on subtle details and world building, all doubled by a strong atmosphere.\n<br><br>\n➣ Gory, fast paced shooting, a solid arsenal of weapons and magic items. Combat is projectile-based, movement is essential, enemies are unique and vary in type and abilities. There is no leveling up, no talent trees, no gradual upgrades - you are in full charge of your skill.\n<br><br>\n➣ Original soundtrack ranging from tense to serene ambient, with occasional bursts of metal. Later in the game you will also hear some of Alexander Brandon's personal tracks that never released in Unreal and Deus Ex!\n<br><br>\n➣ Thousands of hours of work put into an original concept, digitally hand-drawn graphics (textures, sprites, frame by frame animations etc.), scripting, sound effects and level design, all by a one man dev team aiming to create a game with a strong personality and feel.\n<br><br>\n➣ Over eight hours of good old singleplayer action with five difficulties including Brutalizing, which changes the gameplay to allow interesting second playthroughs (different fights &amp; pick-ups, companions etc.) and Bearzerk, which radically changes the combat by replacing guns with new melee weapons.\n<br><br>\n➣ It's very light on storage (under 300mb) and well optimized for the GZDoom Engine.\n<br><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/hedon/SteamCustom_Philosophy.png">\nHedon is built upon elements of classic game design, most importantly the idea that the player needs to be treated with maturity by the game, which should never function as an automatic gratification machine, and require a degree of investment to be fully enjoyed. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/hedon/SteamCustom_Gameplay.png">\nYou will be dropped in a hostile world that has its own workings, characters and intrigues, and you will be expected to fend for yourself. The build up is slow and steady, the story is simple but consistent, the combat is fast paced and ruthless. You will sometimes find yourself lost in a non linear level design with various aesthetics (forest, caves, forge, barracks, snowy mountain etc.) where exploration and learning by yourself is the key to improve.\n<br><br>\nYou may find that Hedon takes a certain amount of atmosphere, gameplay, color and inspiration from games such as Unreal, Blood, Thief, Arx Fatalis, Serious Sam etc. but nonetheless aims to be original at all times.\n<br><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/hedon/SteamCustom_Story.png">\nYou play as Zan, a half Orc - half Demon warrior who wakes up in a caved in tunnel with no memory of how she ended up there. The first episode will focus on our hero's descent into a strange underground world which is threatened by the sudden attack of a massive Cultist force.\n<br>\nThere are certain races and factions populating the world of Hedon.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/hedon/SteamCustom_ZanTiatiDura.png"><br><b>The Iron Division</b><br>\nA faction of amazon-like Orcs and Goblins, the Iron Division are the keepers Hedon's greatest secret - the crystal technology. Various magical crystals sprawl across the underground, providing energy, heat, oxygen and often forming entire biomes around them. Combining this power with crafting and the ancient art of magic, the Iron Division has founded a whole new civilization within their mountain stronghold known as Valc.\n<br><br><b>The Cultists</b><br>\nFallen to sin, the raving husks of what were once human now worship various figures of the Underworld. Little can be done to cull their addiction to pain and suffering. Little but a spray of frag fire or an explosive bolt that is...\n<br><br><b>The Demons</b><br>\nChaotic Demons dwell in the deepest parts of Hedon, lashing out at the weaker minds of the inhabitants of the Overworld. Along the ages, they have subdued entire towns to become their cultist slaves and feed their endless hunger through pain and suffering. Demons only care about feeding, and they will stop at nothing to do so.\n<br><br><b>The Earthborn</b><br>\nAncient dwellers of the underground, Minotaurs and Dwarves have built their own civilizations, ever clenched in warfare with the Demons spawning from below. However, their great cities and heritage were lost hundreds of years after their inevitable defeat in front of Hell's armies, and now they have been scattered and forced to live in small clans and towns.\n<br><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/hedon/SteamCustom_Collaboration.png"><br><b>iamfailtacular</b> - story collaboration/world building, brainstorming\n<br><br><b>Akhzul</b> - Hedon's OST dedicated composer.

Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\n<br><br><h4>Now including...</h4>Play with all major updates since launch: Foundation, Pathfinder, Atlas Rises, NEXT, The Abyss, Visions, the 2.0 BEYOND update, Synthesis, Living Ship, Exo Mech, Desolation and the latest 3.0 update, ORIGINS.\n<br><br>\nAn epic voyage to the centre of a shared universe awaits, allowing you to explore, trade, fight and survive alone or with friends.\n\n<br><br><h4>Embark on an epic voyage</h4>At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.\n<br><br><h4>Find your own destiny</h4>Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you.

An otherworldly usurper has seized Empress Emily Kaldwin’s throne, leaving the fate of the Isles hanging in the balance. As Emily or Corvo, travel beyond the legendary streets of Dunwall to Karnaca, the once-dazzling coastal city that holds the keys to restoring Emily to power.

The world is a character in its own right, rich with story, architecture and eclectic characters. It is also punctuated by signature mission locations, such as the Dust District, ravaged by dust storms and warring factions, and a madman’s mansion made of shifting walls, deadly traps and clockwork soldiers.\n&nbsp;</li><li><b>The Void Engine</b><br>\nDishonored 2 is beautifully brought to life with the new Void Engine, a leap forward in rendering technology, built from id Tech and highly-customized by Arkane Studios.

It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the <b>AI Storyteller</b>. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\n<br><br><b>Your colonists are not professional settlers</b> – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\n<br><br><b>Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play.</b> A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.\n<br><br><b>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.</b> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\n<br><br><b>The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.</b> You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\n<br><br><b>Travel across the planet.</b> You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\n<br><br><b>You can tame and train animals.</b> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\n<br><br><b>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.</b> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\n<br><br><b>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</b> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\n<br><br><b>You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.</b> A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\n<br><br><br>\n(All non-English translations are made by fans.)\n\n\n\n            \n    	59.40	2018-10-16	BR0	2020-12-27 00:50:58.662+00	\N	\N	2020-12-27 00:51:02.127+00	2020-12-27 00:51:02.265+00	61

The only two to walk away from the cataclysm unscathed, the hapless everyman known as the POSTAL Dude and his loyal companion Champ, drive aimlessly through the scorching deserts of Arizona looking for a new place to call home. After a fortuitous gas station rest stop ends with their car, trailer home, and the rest of their worldly possessions stolen, all the Dude’s seemingly got left to his name is his canine cohort and his bathrobe, and neither of them smells all that great. However, on the horizon, the duo glimpses an unfamiliar and dazzling town that beckons to them. What untold prospects lie within? Fame? Fortune? Maybe a bidet or two? Edensin awaits.\n<br><br>\nPOSTAL 4: No Regerts is a satirical and outrageous comedic open world first person shooter and the long-awaited true sequel to what’s been fondly dubbed as "The Worst Game Ever™",  POSTAL 2!

Trust no one while uncovering dire truths – no matter the cost to mind and body.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_council/banner02.png"><br>\nThe Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests –Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_council/banner04.png"><br><br>\nIn a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council’s gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean ‘game over’, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player’s adventure.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_council/banner01.png"><br><br>\nRichet’s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council’s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            The Council © 2018 Cyanide Studio and Focus Home Interactive.

Detailed terrain, rich animations and a slick interface, all within a traditional setting and with the elements that are familiar to experienced players - <b>Order of Battle: World War II follows in the footsteps of all time classics, such as Panzer General.</b><br><br>\nWith a selection of over<b> 700 unique looking and behaving units</b>, players can build and manage their army, fleet and air force throughout the campaigns set in the various theatres of operations during WW2. A unique system of specializations allows players to customize their forces with special units, bonuses and abilities that reflect the difference in strategies and mentality of the various factions.\n<br><br>\nA set of <b>unique Commanders</b> – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns.

Glorious battleships such as USS Arizona were sunk or put out of action for. This infamous raid gave Japan a serious advantage right from the start, but they have sorely underestimated the American determination to overcome this setback and fight back the aggression. Four long years of war now lay ahead to determine the outcome of this epic struggle...\n<br><br><b>As the commanding officer of the US Pacific forces, the player is tasked to put a halt to the Japanese aggression and restore American supremacy in this part of the globe. </b>From the early blow at Pearl Harbor to the final battles in the Japanese archipelago, recruiting new units, giving the right orders and organizing an effective supply chain are essential on the path to ultimate victory. New technologies and equipment will gradually become available, allowing players to modernize their army, fleet and airforce throughout the campaign.\n<br><br>\nIn Order of Battle: U.S. Pacific you take control over the American army and fleet in some of the most iconic land and naval battles of the Pacific Theatre of WW2.\n<br><h4>Scenarios</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li class="description__cool-point">Pearl Harbor\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">War Plan Orange-3\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">Bataan\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">Marshalls-Gilberts Raid\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">Coral Sea\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">Midway\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">Guadalcanal\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">New Georgia\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">Philippine Sea\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">Leyte\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">Okinawa\n<br></li><li class="description__cool-point">Tokyo</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2015 Slitherine Ltd.

ARE YOU MAD?:</h4>Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we’ve been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the community. Without your support and feedback we wouldn’t be where we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you. Here’s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it’s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_cells_-_rise_of_the_giant/CavernTravelling.gif"><h4>Features:</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>New levels</b>: You’ve got a new level that’s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who’s finished the game at least once.

There are additions to the story/lore of the game, new secrets, new blueprints and…\n<br></li><li><b>Skins</b>: People have been requesting this for ages and we’ve finally found the time to make the necessary changes to accomadate the request. You’ve now got access to female skins, fluro skins and a christmas tree skin, cos why the hell not.</li></ul><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_cells_-_rise_of_the_giant/TravellingVerticalAstrolab.gif"><br><br>\nOn top of these major changes we’re continuously trying to update the game in ways that make it more challenging and more just, all the while remaining open to new players. As such you will notice that the difficulty has been rebalanced so that the entry level of the game, while extremely challenging is now in line with the 5 extra difficulty levels available to those who like to suffer.\n<br><br>\nWe hope that you like Rise of the Giant and would like to remind you that we’re not done, we’ll be continuing to make content for the game for as long as you keep demanding it, so feel free to let us know what you’d like to see and if we can make any changes that would make you happy.\n\n\n            \n    	0.00	2019-03-27	BR0	2021-01-31 01:42:57.115+00	\N	\N	2021-01-31 01:42:57.604+00	2021-01-31 01:43:02.921+00	78

The king's powers have faded and he falls asleep for 400 days to regain his might. It is your duty to stay in the earthen palace until he awakens.<h4></h4>As soon as you start, the game inevitably counts down the 400 days - even when you stop playing and exit the game.<h4></h4>It is now up to you to decide what to do with your solitary existence beneath the soil. Don't stress yourself, you have plenty of time.<h4>Choose your playing style:</h4><h4></h4>Start the game and simply come back after 400 days to see how it ends. You actually don't have to play the game at all. But the Shade will be even more lonely without you.<h4></h4><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_longing/longing_king.gif"><h4></h4>Or explore the caves and collect items for your comfortable underground living room. Just send the Shade to take a stroll - the walking speed is slow, but luckily there is no need to hurry.<h4></h4><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_longing/longing_labyrinth.gif"><h4></h4>Read tons of classic literature from Nietzsche to Moby Dick right in the game - or at least have the shade read them. After all, time goes by faster if you learn to keep your mind occupied.

The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.\n<br><br>\nThe music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!\n<br><br>\nTreasure Adventure Game was created by Stephen Orlando. He spent over 2 years of his life developing it. When you see the scope and detail in this game, it’s hard to believe that it was created by just one guy. But it was!

One such hero is a farmer in the small village of West Harbor. Raised by the elven ranger, Daeghun, as his own child, our hero will embark on a grandiose quest against the King of Shadows. Neverwinter Nights 2 is the tale of his deeds. His adventures continue in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer. Our protagonist discovers that an ominous spell has fallen on him. A curse of perpetual hunger--one which can only be quelled by consuming the souls of spirits. In order to remove the curse, he has to travel to the Shadow Realm, which harbors dark secrets and tormented souls.\n<br><br>\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir gives as a breather from grand quests of destiny and epic ordeals. You simply assemble a group of four adventurers (either by carefully picking out each of their statistics and skills or by randomly re-rolling your characters until you find the ones that suit you) and go where the wind takes you. Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast. Then, yet another adventure: in an ancient and forgotten tomb you found an unusual mask. It made you quite powerful but changed your life into a living nightmare. Strange, terrifying visions torment your psyche. Every time you try to get rid of the accursed mask, it secretly makes its way back to you. There's just one solution: set sail for Westgate and discover the secret of the Night Masks in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mysteries of Westgate.\n<br><br>\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Complete is an epic RPG set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the most popular campaign settings of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Use all the wicked spells, feats, and prestige classes from the D&amp;D 3.5 rules. Create your characters any way you wish, choosing from a wide variety of races and subraces, such as Tiefling and Aasimar. As if the pre-made campaigns weren't enough, you can take the reins and use the powerful Obsidian Neverwinter NIghts 2 Toolset to make your own adventures and share them with friends!\n<br><br>\nIf you're looking for a truly epic experience, you can't go wrong with our <b><a href="http://www.gog.com/news/mod_spotlight_baldurs_gate_reloaded_nwn2_mod">Mod Spotlight for Neverwinter Nights 2 Complete!</a></b><ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Neverwinter Nights 2: Complete includes the original game, and three expansions: Mask of the Betrayer, Storm of Zehir, and Mysteries of Westgate.</li><li class="description__features-point">Create and host your own solo and multiplayer D&amp;D adventures using the improved Neverwinter Nights 2 Toolset.</li><li class="description__features-point">Rediscover many familiar locations and reunite with your companions from the Neverwinter Nights series.</li><li class="description__features-point">More than 100 hours of immersive adventure across four campaigns, all rendered in breathtaking detail.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2013 Wizards.

Now all the sword wielding action, adventure and drama of the Way of the Samurai series comes to PC, continuing the series' blend of customization, exploration, action gameplay and quirky humour.\n<br><br>\nWay of the Samurai 4 takes place in the humble port town of Amihama during the mid 19th Century, several years after the arrival of the "black ships" from the West ended Japan's long history of cultural isolation. Amihama's downtown area has slowly been converted to a "Little Britain", complete with European-styled buildings, occupied by an influx of adventurous foreign settlers. Not everyone welcomes these new residents though, and three distinct factions with opposing ideals begin to take shape.\n<br><br>\nYou must take on the role of a master-less samurai looking to establish yourself in this conflicted land of opportunity and uncertainty. It is up to you to decide which faction to support in an almighty conflict amongst the region's three powers, and so direct the course of Japan's history.\n<br><br>\nWill you aid the shogunate pro-government in their attempts to keep the peace and establish cordial relations with the foreign contingent? Will you help the nationalistic isolationists in their attempts to exile this potential threat to the Japanese way of life?\nOr will you ally with the foreigners directed by the British Navy in their attempts to establish silk trade and foster cultural exchange? \n<br><br>\nWho will you support? Who will you betray? Become the ultimate bastion of virtue or the ultimate disgrace to humanity, and do it however you'd like. The choice is entirely your own...\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Branching storylines with multiple endings</li><li class="description__features-point">Dynamic combat system</li><li class="description__features-point">Vast array of melee and gunpowder weaponry</li><li class="description__features-point">Extensive character customization</li><li class="description__features-point">Key event decision making</li><li class="description__features-point">Sword collecting</li><li class="description__features-point">Original Japanese voiceover with English subtitles</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.

Explore floating shrines, infiltrate the lair of an outlawed secret society and learn the tells of a new boss. This is new mid game content for people looking for alternatives to the Stilt Village, Clock Tower and Time Keeper areas and their parallels.<br><br>\nTeam up with a powerful new Brutality based ally. She’s bloodthirsty and head over heels with you, so be gentle. Or not… Either way you’ll need her help as you explore more of the island; spread over two new levels and a boss fight which include four and a half new enemies, a veritable arsenal of weapons and of course a bunch of hidden tidbits of lore.<br><br>\nThe Fractured Shrines: While the breathtaking view may be distracting, you’ll need to keep your eye on the crows as you caper from platform to platform, sidestepping spear-wielding snakes, skirting sadistic new traps and vaulting over the seemingly bottomless void. All this, while trying not to wake the menacing axe hefting stone statues. Nothing to it.<br><br>\nThe Undying Shores: Your holiday plans have been spoiled by enemies that won’t seem to stay dead, which is something of a problem when attempting to navigate a slippery cliff face. Worse still, the weather’s taken a nasty turn and doused your hopes for some R&amp;R on the beach, not to mention the creepy lantern wielding wizards that keep blocking your path with their shovel brandishing minions. It’s turning out to be rather stressful really.<br><br>\nThe Mausoleum: A new humanoid boss with his own story to tell, tough pattern based combat and a magnificent setting for a showdown.<br><br>\nOn top of the new areas, enemies and pet sword… thing... you’ll of course need new tools for killing, wouldn’t be much of a DLC without them to be fair. Here we’ve added in a bunch of new weapons with designs that might take a little more figuring out than some (they can’t all just be frying pans), but once you’ve got the hang of them you’ll be unstoppable.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            Copyright Motion Twin 2021 ©\n        </p>	10.89	2021-01-25	BR0	2021-01-31 20:23:01.254+00	\N	\N	2021-01-31 20:23:03.429+00	2021-01-31 20:23:03.555+00	78

As the undisputed 1999 Game of the Year, Unreal Tournament grabbed the first person shooter genre by the soiled seat of its pants and knocked it around the room with its never-before-seen graphics, brutal edge-of-your-seat gameplay and a massive and varied feature list that gave gamers more than they ever expected.\n<br><br>\nWith enhanced AI, bots in Unreal Tournament play as if they're jacked up on a big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually perfected, their understanding of the game rules is professorial, their ability to navigate levels is GPS-like, and their threat to your existence is very real.\n<br><br>\nUnreal Tournament's robust UBrowser system provides the easiest way to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle, eliminating the need to download third-party server querying applications, and virtually any option you want to tweak can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy!\n<br><br>\nThanks to Spectator Cams, you can enter a game and hop around to view the action on the level. Even cooler, the camera can be "attached" to one of the players in the level to view the action from their perspective. \n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Multiple game modes on dozens of ingeniously designed maps</li><li class="description__features-point">Great weapons with multiple fire modes, some innovative, all of them useful and balanced</li><li class="description__features-point">Awesome gameplay and low system requirements - the perfect title for an ad-hoc LAN party</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2000, Epic Games, Inc.

Get to know every cliff and crevice as you plan pistes, place lifts and build essential facilities. Take on the challenge to create a resort where life is always good!<h4>Plan your pistes</h4>\nPlace pistes on the mountainside in just a few clicks with the easy-to-use creation tool. Read the terrain, and choose the best spot to lay down trails for every skier ability.\n<br><br>\n11 different types of ski lift give you plenty of choice for scaling the heights. 12-person gondola lifts are fast, but tricky to build on the steep mountain slopes. A two-person chairlift might be a better choice, but watch out for queues at the bottom!\n<br><br>\nLuckily, ever-advancing ski lift technology means there are always new options to try. The latest models can make even the highest peaks accessible in no time.\n<br><br>\nPlan, build and improve until you’ve created your dream ski area.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/snowtopia_ski_resort_tycoon/mp4/build2_gif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h4>Welcome skiers of every kind</h4>\nYou might have thought perfect pistes were enough to keep skiers happy, but it’s not so simple. With 12 different skier profiles in the game, some are more interested in a good raclette, while others come to commune with nature. And then there are the hardcore ski fanatics, who won’t settle for anything less than the longest run the mountain has to offer.\n<br><br>\nThere’s no money in Snowtopia. Make your skiers happy enough and they might  join the team of volunteers running the resort. Divide your workforce between the lift operators, maintenance crew, service facilities, and resort improvement team.\n<br><br>\nGrowing the reputation of your resort leads to more skiers on the slopes. But beware - more skiers means more accidents! Make sure you have enough snow groomers and ski patrols to keep the slopes safe at all times.\n<br><br>\nRemember, no one likes a broken chairlift, but everyone loves sunbathing on the terrace! \n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/snowtopia_ski_resort_tycoon/mp4/management2_gif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h4>Sit back and chill on the mountain</h4>\nOnce your resort is built and your skiers are happy, you deserve a little break. So find yourself a perfect little corner on the mountain to drink it all in, maybe near a pretty forest piste next to a ski lift perched on a picturesque clifftop.\n<br><br>\nYou’re in the mountains. Enjoy the frosty kiss of the cold air on your face and kick back to some cool tunes.\n<br><br>\nWelcome to Snowtopia, the game where it’s good to just chill.\n\n\n            \n    	42.79	1969-12-31	BR0	2021-01-31 20:23:01.095+00	\N	\N	2021-01-31 20:23:03.422+00	2021-01-31 20:23:03.549+00	109

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. The player can then decide to place one of his followers, so called Meeples, on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner. Each new game is a new experience thanks to the ever-changing landscape.<br><br><b>ENJOY FUN AND TACTICAL GAMEPLAY</b><br><br>\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: "Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?" or "Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, making it harder for him to complete his goal and score points?" Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br><br><b>FEATURES</b><br><br>\n• Fun and tactical gameplay adapted from the award-winning Carcassonne board game<br>\n• Solo mode<br>\n• Pass &amp; Play on the same device with your friends and family &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>\n• Detection of blocked locations once the tile is placed.<br>\n• Online multiplayer mode includes:<br>\n- Public games to play with players all around the world<br>\n- Private games to invite your friends<br>\n- Ranked games and leaderboards<br>\n- Chat &amp; Lobby<br>\n• 3D modelisation (vs 2D for the previous versions and the physical game)<br>\n• Additional strategic layers compared to the physical version:<br>\n- field view which allows you to see the field possession of each player<br>\n- remaining tile list: allows you to see the tiles which are remaining in the draw pile<br>\n• 2D/3D view swap<br><br><p class="description__copyrights">\n            copyright 2017 Hans im Glück Verlag GmbH\n        </p>	8.29	2017-11-28	BR0	2021-01-31 20:23:00.377+00	\N	\N	2021-01-31 20:23:03.419+00	2021-01-31 20:23:03.544+00	75

Mostly because it actually has been. The side project that was supposed to take a few months instead sprawled into a retail game that has taken several years to complete.\n<br><br>\nBrave Earth wears its influences a bit... shamelessly on its sleeve. The game was originally conceived to be a freeware "study" game for me -- learning through emulation. But the product I'm releasing is more than just emulation. I've tried my best to both understand and then build upon one of my favorite eras in platformers to almost arrive at a uniquely different alternative reality. A more modern sensibility without playing like a modern take on a retro game.\n<br><br>\nAs George Lucas's Star Wars built upon and paid tribute Flash Gordon while establishing its own voice, I'm hoping Brave Earth can do the same.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/brave_earth_prologue/pub.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>\nThis is Dan Stern from Dangen Entertainment. I’m both pleased and proud to present Brave Earth: Prologue. \n<br><br>\nI’ve said in other places how happy I am for pixel art to have made a come back with the independent development scene. The pixel art in BEP is excellent, but what I have found to stand out and amaze me in this game is the meticulous care that Kayin put into designing the encounters. It doesn’t come as any surprise to me considering his previous work, but in no time at all I got the feeling that he was in my own head in a sense. \n<br><br>\nKayin’s complete understanding of player psychology is as enviable as it is rare in game development. I Wanna Be the Guy was a game that was completely designed around it. Traps spring up and invisible blocks bar your path, leading to your frequent death. It was almost as much a commentary on game design in a meta sense as it was a clever arrangement of platforming puzzles. \n<br><br>\nIn Brave Earth: Prologue, by contrast, traps and obstacles are laid bare before you. This is not a game meant to trick you cleverly, but rather to masterfully utilize a comprehensive understanding of what makes for a satisfying challenge.\n<br><br>\nIt’s remarkable that the game also leads the player along a logical path through the game’s world, with three totally different playable characters, no less. While level-based rather than open world, BEP still gave me a powerful sense of progress, journey and adventure. To find that depth of setting in a game with so much attention paid to the gameplay balance is impressive to say the least.\n<br><br>\nI couldn’t be more proud to work with a talented developer like Kayin. This game is a masterpiece of 8-bit era game design and it vastly raises the bar in my eyes as a gamer. I can’t wait for you all to experience it.\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT is a trademark of Dangen Entertainment.\nCopyright © 2017 Dangen Entertainment.

You will be able to <b>observe the slow process of construction</b>. A team of carpenters, masons, architects and ordinary workers will rise building step by step. It will not be just a graphic feature - the building process is costly and will have an impact on the finances or the public mood.\n<br><br><b>War</b><br>\nEgypt's history is full of clashes of emerging and failing empires.

In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities.\n<br><br>\nThese swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2020 Ape Tribe Games.

For decades, the U.S. Navy has deployed the river patrol boat (PBR) for a most hostile and claustrophobic type of war: riverine combat. Now you’ve been drafted.\n<br><br>\nThe Colombian drug cartel. Loyal troops of a deposed Panamanian dictator. Renegade Viet Cong. They’re on the river — waiting — around any river bend. Bullets rip through the thick jungle air as you maneuver your Gunboat through over 20 missions in hell. They swear the river will run red with your blood. But you’ve got other orders.\n<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Enter 3 sweltering combat zones: Vietnam, Colombia, and Panama\n<br></li><li>Operate a U.S. Navy River Patrol Boat (PBR) in over 20 missions. Three different maps, identifying target destinations and key sites on the river.\n<br></li><li>Step into the abyss known as “Riverine Operations.” Your M60 smolders, cocked for yet another round. Spotlights and radar are fully functional. Soldiers, bridges, mines, docks, sampans, APC’s and canyons are depicted in deadly detail.\n<br></li><li>Get a first-person perspective from 4 battle stations. Fire salvos from the bow, stern and mid-section of the boat – or take the helm as pilot. All four men are cross-trained in each other’s tasks — redundancy becomes crucial if one or two crew members are wounded or dead.\n<br></li><li>Open fire with authentic gunboat weaponry. Twin .50 cal. M2HB machine guns, .30 cal. M60D general purpose machine guns, Mini-TAT rapid-fire gatling gun, mortars and grenade launchers.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            2021 © Ziggurat Interactive, Accolade is a registered trademark of Billion Soft (Hong Kong) Limited.

The Celtic society, a complex tapestry of different religions, human cultures, and mortal and immortal races such as the Mourians, Werewolves, Goblins, and monsters threaten to tear at every seam. Will you support the immature, yet rightful, heir, or the pragmatic general in their bid for the throne? What alliances will you forge, what friendships will you foster, what romances will you pursue, and... what will you do when you are suddenly thrust into Medieval Spain?<h4>EXPLORE TWO ERAS</h4>Things look pretty different in Galicia under Christianity than it did under Celtic rule. Magic is fading, religion is everywhere, and much has changed. Where are your immortal allies now, and what has become of the souls of your mortal friends?

Take up the role of leader by assuming command of one of 5 factions, and set out to conquer the coveted "Factory". Lead your mechs to war and your people to victory!&nbsp;<br>\n"In an alternate reality in 1920s Europa, it's been several years since the ""Great War"", but the ashes of the conflict are still hot and the war is entering a new phase. The first conflict saw the emergence of some incredible engines of war known as Mechs. Built by ""The Factory"", an independent city-state which has since become the object of everyone's desire, these technological monstrosities roam the snowy landscapes of Europa. Be the hero of one of the five factions – Saxony Empire, Crimean Khanate, Rusviet Union, Polania Republic or Nordic Kingdom – and become the richest and most powerful nation in all of Europa during these dark times! To assure the victory of your people, you will need to explore and conquer new territories, enlist new recruits and deploy your forces by building formidable and terrifying combat Mechs. Replay history in a fictional past full of mechanical engines and technology, where each choice you make will be critical. Choose your battles with care, because in Scythe, victory is achieved with and for the people!<br><br><b>Gameplay:&nbsp;</b><br>\n- Asymmetry: every player starts the game with different resources (energy, coins, keen combat sense, popularity…), a different starting location and a secret objective. The starting positions are specifically set to contribute to the uniqueness of every faction and the asymmetrical nature of the game.<br>\n- Strategy: Scythe offers players almost complete control over their fate. The only elements of chance apart from each player's individual secrete objective card are the Encounter cards, which players draw to interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Combat is also handled by way of choice; no luck or chance is involved.<br>\n- Engine Building: Players can improve their construction abilities to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits into their faction, activate mechs to dissuade opponents from invading and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. This aspect creates a feeling of energy and progression over the course of the entire game. The order in which players get to develop their economy and technologies adds to the unique feel of every game, even when playing as the same faction several times.<br><br><b>Features:</b><br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Official adaptation of the award-winning board game<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4X strategy game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate)&nbsp;<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Customize the mat to sharpen your strategy<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Choose a specialty for unique games: Agriculturalist, Industrialist, Engineer, Patriot or Mechanic.&nbsp;<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fight alone against an AI, face your friends in Hotseat or face opponents from all over the world in Online Mode<br>\n•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Check out artistic genius Jakub Rozalski's retro-futuristic illustrations!\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            © Asmodee Digital 2018.

Design, maintain and manage a hi-tech hospital facility, making the most of limited resources and turning cures into cash. The Grim Reaper stalks the corridors, the ill have some very odd ailments, and the staff want to play doctors and nurses together. No matter how you look at it, you're in control of a very sick hospital.\n<br><br>\nIf there is one word that describes Theme Hospital then it has to be “hilarious.” Almost everything in this game is made with great dose of humour. You might think that someone's illness is not a laughing matter but wait till you see a patient with KingComplex dressed as Elvis or serious case of Hairyitis caused from prolonged exposure to the moon. Finding treatments for such diseases is a part of your job, but there’s no prescription to cure the insanity that may result from trying to figure out those cures. You start off small with an empty building, a few doctors, a general diagnostic, a pharmacy, a reception desk, and a few other necessities. From there it’s up to you to move your way up in the health care industry.\n<br><br>\nA hospital simulator is not something you might consider a good theme for a game but the guys from Bullfrog Productions were famous for creating innovative and fun titles from the craziest idea--and Theme Hospital no exception. This game is a piece of art and definitely the best “hospital” simulation so check it out.

When an old wound com	<h4>His legend begins with you! </h4><br>\nBefore he was the world’s greatest detective, <b>Sherlock Holmes</b> was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth.\n<br><br>\nAs Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.\n<br><br>\nWhether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be.\n<br><br><h4>KEY PILLARS: </h4><br><b>The Man Before:</b> As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you’re living it.\n<br><br><b>Global Investigation:</b> You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace.\n<br><br><b>And Stay Down:</b> Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean.\n<br><br><b>A Different Jon:</b> Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?\n<br><br><b>A Darkening Tide:</b> A vibrant open-world island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.\n<br><br><b>Truth and Lies:</b> There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.\n\n            \n    	518.39	1969-12-31	BR0	2021-01-31 20:38:31.403+00	\N	\N	2021-01-31 20:38:34.762+00	2021-01-31 20:38:34.892+00	181

Today, a quaint island in the Baltic Sea. In 2155, a sprawling metropolis able to compete with major world powers. Thanks to the Space Elevator, a technological marvel built by Bornholm's corporate consortium, The Conglomerate, few nations on the planet are more influential both in industrial matters and space exploration.\n<br><br>\nIn Born Punk, the player slips into the role of three people (well, two people, depending on your stance on artificial lifeforms) living on the island: <b>Eevi</b>, a corporate combat hacker turned bartender down on her luck; <b>Mariposa</b>, the CEO of Bornholm's biggest corporation; and an android who calls himself <b>Grandmaster Flashdrive</b>. Oh, and there's a cat. The player can also play as the cat. <b>CAT.</b><br><br>\nThe three characters have one thing in common: they all, one after another, get possessed by strange entities of unknown origin and even less known intentions. They must work together - and sometimes against each other - to find out of the nature of those beings, what they want, and why they seem to think that their 'mission' is of vital importance for the future of humanity.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/born_punk/mp4/ezgif.com-optimize_(1).gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><h4>Key features: </h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>A classic point-and-click adventure experience:</b> we're very proud to feature our own distinct style, but we are also definitely influenced by games like Monkey Island or Beneath a Steel Sky and try to please both veteran afficionados of the genre and newcomers alike with a traditional pixel-art appearance and a streamlined, modern approach to game design\n<br></li><li><b>Movement everywhere:</b> you won't feel like you're walking through a still life painting; Born Punk's world is alive and full of animation, soundscapes and small details to discover\n<br></li><li><b>Choices and consequences:</b> often, it's possible to approach dialogues and puzzles from different angles.

In the campaig	<b>Nebuchadnezzar</b> is a classic isometric city builder game inviting players to experience the mysterious history and culture of ancient Mesopotamia. In the campaign, players get to rule over influential historical cities filled with magnificent monuments.<h4>Gameplay</h4>From plowing fields to creating products, players must oversee the manufacturing of agriculture and goods for the city population. Players have an arsenal of tools to optimize their objectives. In addition, a maximum overview of their city helps players to solve problems and prevent population loss. Nebuchadnezzar’s gameplay is geared towards all types of players: from beginners of the genre to experienced strategists.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/nebuchadnezzar/overview_1.png"><h4>Campaign</h4>Nebuchadnezzar’s main campaign contains 16 historical missions covering the colonization of ancient lands to the conquest of Babylon by Persians in 6th Century BC. Each mission summons a different time period in Ancient Mesopotamian history. Players must carry out tasks important to the specific time and place of each mission, including the construction of historical monuments.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/nebuchadnezzar/overview_2.png"><h4>Monuments</h4>During the campaign players will not only build complex ancient monuments, but design them too. Nebuchadnezzar features an in-game “monument editor” giving players complete control over their buildings. From structural design to color scheme to final details: it’s in the hands of the player. Will you recreate history or make history? It’s up to you.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/nebuchadnezzar/overview_3.png"><h4>Mods &amp; Localization</h4>Nebuchadnezzar was created with mods and localization in mind.

A continuation of Event Horizon’s attempt, which began with the studio’s debut title Tower of Time, to shatter long-standing RPG tropes and to create something unique in the process.\n<br><br>\nExplore the world using your Skyship, your base of operations. Hunt for mythical locations, and procedurally generated dungeons with optional tactical objectives. Choose wisely where to travel however, as the world map adjusts with the passing of in-game time, becoming progressively more challenging.\n\n<h4>Story</h4><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dark_envoy/desert_550.png" style="margin: auto;display:block;width: 600px"><br>\n\nAs the Human Empire fights for dominance against the remnants of the Old Races, Dark Technology clashes against Magic — neither side is good and just.  The strong prey on the weak taking whatever they please. This is total war, where the defeated will be entirely wiped from the pages of history.\n<br><br>\nAgainst this backdrop, Kaela and Malakai aspire to repair their parents’ broken airship in order to travel the world, seeking to face whatever dungeons, challenges, and riches may come their way.  They are hungry to learn how to fight, build, and forge alliances and friendships across the known lands. Together, they search for ancient relics and forgotten places. Together, they look to leave a legacy in their wake…\n<br><br>\nYet, their journey begins in blood and tragedy.\n<br><br>\nYour choices are everything and they can reshape your life in this place, even the world around you.  Will you become strong enough to survive the journey and reach the end? Will you find the power to change this grim reflection of our own world? Will your legacy be one of peace and honor, or stained by bloodshed and destruction?\n<br><br>\nWhen you look in the mirror at the end, what reflection will you see there?<h4>Features</h4><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Non-linear RPG with real time combat (with slow or pause) where tactics and party power are equally important.\n<br></li><li> Player choices impact the world: it can be destroyed or saved, and the stories that unfold will lead to multiple endings reflecting the characters’ personalities and decisions. \n<br></li><li> 4 base classes / 16 specialization classes to discover - with the ability to mix skill trees - including some rare classes which can only be found in remote locations or through chained quests.\n<br></li><li> New RPG system, promoting experimentation and requiring frequent adaptation to the new challenges.\n<br></li><li> 4K Graphics, Free movement camera, Multiple enviro biomes, Visually Striking VFX, Cutscenes (in-game and animated illustrations), Animations created with in-house MOCAP, Great Soundtrack, Character Customization, Day/Night cycle, Crafting, Enchanting, Research\n<br></li><li> High-replayability factor due to large pool of quests, local, and world events.
